# Langton's Ant in C

This project demonstrates a simple text-based rendering of the famous Langton's Ant in C, the project can be built with CMake.

Langton's ant is a two-dimensional Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. It was invented by Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on a square lattice of black and white cells. The idea has been generalized in several different ways, such as turmites which add more colors and more states.
